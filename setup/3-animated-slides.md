# 3. Animated slides, title cards and overlays

Captions come from `hub-video`. Anything that moves and is not your footage comes from
HyperFrames: an open-source renderer that turns a web page with an animation timeline into an
MP4, frame by frame. You never write the page. Your assistant does, following the HyperFrames
recipes the setup put in your hub, and it shows you the result.

## Three things to ask for first

> Make a five-second vertical title card that says "Three things I learned this week", in white on dark blue.

> Put a lower third with my name and "hub builder" over the first eight seconds of ~/Videos/intro.mp4.

> Turn these three points into a 20-second vertical slideshow, one point per slide: ...

## What happens

1. Your assistant asks a few short questions if it needs to: the shape (vertical or wide),
   the look, how long. Say what you know; "you choose" is a fine answer.
2. It makes a project folder next to your footage, never inside the hub, writes the
   composition, and runs HyperFrames' own check on it.
3. It renders an MP4 into the project folder and looks at still frames from it before it tells
   you it is done.

A three-second card rendered in about 14 seconds on the author's desktop. A three-minute video
with seventeen cards over a talking head takes minutes, not seconds. The first render also
downloads the browser HyperFrames draws with.

## Graphics over a talking head

The heaviest thing it does, and the one the author uses most: your clip plays untouched and
designed cards appear at the moments you mention something (a book, a website, a number). Ask:

> Put graphic cards over ~/Videos/talk.mp4 at the moments I mention something worth showing. Here are two screenshots to use: ...

Expect a first version and a round of corrections. "Move the quote up, it covers my eyes" is
the kind of note that works. Captions go on last, on top of the render:

> Now caption the rendered video.

## To watch while it works

`hub-video hyperframes preview`, run in the project folder, opens the composition in your
browser with a timeline you can scrub. You do not need it; it is there when you want to see a
card before the render.

## About the pin, and what stays on your computer

HyperFrames 0.8.43 is installed once, in `~/.hub-video/hyperframes`, and the recipes in your hub
belong to that version. Your assistant runs it as `hub-video hyperframes`, never through `npx`,
which would fetch whatever version is newest (and which Hermes blocks as a download anyway).
When a newer add-on moves the pin, running the setup line again replaces both.

In the hub's copy of HyperFrames' recipes, two things differ from the original: every
`npx hyperframes` reads `hub-video hyperframes`, and each recipe's first page starts with a
short note saying so. Each recipe folder's `.installed-by-hub-video` file records that.

`hub-video hyperframes` turns off HyperFrames' anonymous usage reports and its habit of updating
skill folders outside your hub. It refuses the commands that publish to HeyGen's hosting, render
in the cloud, sign in or send feedback. If you want one of those, run it yourself with
`npx hyperframes@0.8.43 <command>`; it is then your decision, not your assistant's.
